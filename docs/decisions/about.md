# About

An Architectural Decision (AD) is a software design choice that addresses a functional or non-functional requirement that is architecturally significant. This might, for instance, be a technology choice (for instance Java vs. JavaScript), a choice of the IDE (for instance IntelliJ vs. Eclipse IDE), a choice between a library (for instance SLF4J vs java.util.logging), or a decision on features (for instance infinite undo vs. limited undo). Do not take the term “architecture” too seriously or interpret it too strongly. As the examples illustrate, any decisions that might have an impact on the architecture somehow are architectural decisions.

It should be as convenient as possible to a) write down the decisions and b) to version the decisions.
